# **Sound Propagation over Undulating Seabed**

## **Project Description**
This project is organized into two primary directories:  
- **data**: Includes scripts for time-frequency analysis of the raw data.  

---

## **Project Overview**
This project validates sound propagation characteristics using the **Spectral Parabolic Equation** and experimental data. A comparison between the calculated distance-dependent intensity and measured data demonstrates the consistency of the propagation model with experimental results. Based on this validation, the project refines the attenuation formula for turbine noise as a function of distance.
